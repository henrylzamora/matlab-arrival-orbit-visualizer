A project to create a MATLAB tool to visual orbits, particularly the arrival orbit after an interplanetary transfer has executed. 

The code allows users to interact with the specifics of depature planet, date, time of flight, and arrival planet. 
Furthermore, it permits users to tweak various parameters to modulate specifiy parameters to visualize changes in the orbit. 

Download the files and run the .mlapp file. 
The code is functional but not optimize, further updates to follow. 

A sincere thanks to my advisor, Dr. Marco Maggia who created the solution for the interplanetary transfer and arrival.
